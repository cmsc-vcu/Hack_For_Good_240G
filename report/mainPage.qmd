## Mission Statement

We wanted to create this website to inform people of all the small things they do every day that may have an effect on the climate. While we aren't very concious of these things when we are doing them, it may help to draw some attention to them so you can be more deliberate when you are going about your day everyday. 

### Why you should care

The effects of the warming climate on our daily lives cannot be understated as we continue to be plagued by rising oceans and terrible natural disasters. While it would be more helpful for sweeping changes to be made in regard to the climate, by larger organizations, we can't always count on others to take action. This is why it's important for you, yes you, to take action in your own life when you can.
