## Mission Statement

We wanted to create this website to inform people of all the small things they do every day that may have an effect on the climate. While we aren't very concious of these things when we are doing them, it may help to draw some attention to them so you can be more deliberate when you are going about your day everyday. 

### Why you should care

The effects of the warming climate on our daily lives cannot be understated as we continue to be plagued by rising oceans and terrible natural disasters. While it would be more helpful for sweeping changes to be made in regard to the climate, by larger organizations, we can't always count on others to take action. This is why it's important for you, yes you, to take action in your own life when you can. 

### Recycling

- **Conserve Resources:** Recycling reduces the need for timber, water, and minerals.  
- **Climate Impact:** In 2018, recycling and composting prevented 193 million metric tons of COâ‚‚.  
- **Save Energy:** Recycling 10 plastic bottles powers a laptop for 25+ hours.  
- **Reduce Waste & Pollution:** Recycling keeps waste out of landfills and lowers emissions.

- **Minimizes Resource Extraction:** Helps reduce the environmental impact of mining, logging, and drilling.  
- **Promotes Sustainability:** Recycling ensures the continued availability of resources for future generations.

### Transportation

- **Reduces Emissions:** Efficient transportation systems lower greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.  
- **Conserves Fuel:** Public transit, biking, and carpooling reduce reliance on fossil fuels.  
- **Decreases Traffic Congestion:** Improved transportation planning minimizes road congestion and travel time.  
- **Supports Sustainable Mobility:** Investing in eco-friendly transport options promotes long-term environmental benefits.

### **Take Action Today**  

Protecting the environment starts with simple everyday choices. Recycle when you can, use less energy, choose sustainable transportation, and cut down on waste. Small actions add up, and the more people who make these changes, the bigger the impact. Do your part, spread the word, and help create a cleaner, healthier planet for the future.
